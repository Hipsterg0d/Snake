# Snake

My own implementation of the snake game.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to build the snake game with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Hipsterg0d/snake.git
```

## Prerequisites

For compiling the project first install SFML:
```
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```

## Installing

To compile the project navigate into the cloned directory:
```
cd snake
```
Here simply run the Makefile to start the compilation:
```
make
```
It's also possible to generate doxygen-documentation:
```
make docs
```

## Playing

Start the compiled program to play the game:
```
./snake
```

# Snake

My own implementation of the snake game.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to build the snake game with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Hipsterg0d/snake.git
```

## Prerequisites

For compiling the project first install SFML:
```
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```

## Installing

To compile the project navigate into the cloned directory:
```
cd snake
```
Here create a new director called build:
```
mkdir build; cd build
```
Now build the project:
```
cmake ..
make
```

## Playing

Go back to the project director and start the compiled program to play the game:
```
cd ..
./build/snake
```
